   ```

## üö® Security Warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Going Live:

- [ ] Verify Firebase security rules are restrictive
- [ ] Ensure Turnstile is configured for production domain
- [ ] Test rate limiting with actual traffic patterns
- [ ] Verify CSP doesn't break functionality
- [ ] Check all external API endpoints are secure
- [ ] Confirm no debug information leaks in production

### üîí Post-Deployment:

- [ ] Monitor error rates and performance
- [ ] Review security headers with security scanner
- [ ] Test functionality from different networks
- [ ] Verify SSL/TLS configuration
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

## üìã Rollback Plan

If issues are detected after deployment:

1. **Immediate rollback:**

   ```bash
   wrangler pages deployment list
   wrangler pages deployment rollback [DEPLOYMENT_ID]
   ```

2. **Fix issues locally and redeploy:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run deploy:check
   pnpm wrangler pages deploy .svelte-kit/cloudflare
   ```
